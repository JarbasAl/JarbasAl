<h2 id="leadingopenvoiceosandhivemind">Leading OpenVoiceOS and HiveMind</h2>
<p>I am currently the lead developer for two significant projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openvoiceos.org/">OpenVoiceOS</a> - Leading development efforts for OpenVoiceOS, a non-profit organization creating frameworks for voice-enabling various applications and devices. This project aims to empower voice technology and make it accessible to everyone.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/JarbasHiveMind/">HiveMind</a>- Serving as the lead developer for HiveMind, a protocol designed to connect multiple voice assistants and enable seamless collaboration between them. HiveMind represents the future of voice technology interconnectivity.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="professionalexperiencehighlights">Professional Experience Highlights</h1>
<p>I embarked on a journey as a self-employed Software Engineer since January 2017. This freelance role has allowed me to specialize in the voice assistant space, working remotely from Portugal. 
I have had the privilege of working in various capacities that have honed my skills as a software engineer and open-source developer.</p>
<p>My journey started as a Software Engineer at XERLOK (based in Argentina). Here, I led the development of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for an emotional smart assistant. My responsibilities included selecting reference hardware, creating a reference Raspberry Pi image, developing a local web UI, implementing basic vision capabilities like face tracking and emotion recognition, and building a basic speaker recognition system using Gaussian Mixture Models. I also assisted in the automatic translation of NLP resources into Spanish</p>
<p>Other of my recent roles has been as a Software Engineer at <a href="http://neon.ai/">NEONGECKO.COM INC</a>, (Mycroft Channel Partners) where I've been involved in voice assistant Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects since 2019.</p>
<p>A significant chapter in my career was spent at <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hellochatterbox/chatterbox-the-smart-speaker-that-kids-build-and-p">Chatterbox</a>, where I was the co-founder and served as a Full Stack Engineer from May 2018 to November 2021. During my tenure, I successfully developed the full stack for a privacy-respecting educational smart assistant that kids build and teach themselves. My accomplishments included overseeing a succesfull Kickstarter campaign, creating a versatile library for voice assistant creation, and developing a proprietary voice assistant stack. I also worked on creating a intuitive React + Blockly-based UI that kids use to build skills</p>
<p>I remain actively engaged in projects like OpenVoiceOS and HiveMind, continuing to contribute and innovate in the voice technology domain.</p>
